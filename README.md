# EXTRA NOTE!!!!!!
Because google sucks at keeping their docs up to date with their apis there are currently two versions of the serial api docs out there.  This is the real one:

To get this app to work
1. Enable "Developer Mode" on the Chrome settings > Extensions page
2. Click load unpacked Extensions
3. Navigate to the directory this file is in and click 'Select'
4. Open a new Chrome Tab or click Apps in the bookmark bar.
5. You should see the icon for "Aleph Chrome App." Click that and away we go.
